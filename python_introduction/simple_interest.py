# simple_interest.py

# Define the principal amount, rate of interest, and time
principal = 1000         # $1000 initial investment
rate = 0.05              # 5% annual interest rate
time = 3                 # investment period in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
